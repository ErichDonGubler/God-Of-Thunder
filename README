A brief description of lightning types (all struck where you aim, of course):
- Normal: a single strike.
- Chain: Strike a lightning effect at sight, then strikes all living entities (except the caster) within the configured radius.
- Explosive: Strikes and explodes with the configured amount of force (about 4 is the strength of a Creeper)
- Diffusive: Strikes an effect and sets fire to everything within the configureed radius.
- Fake: Like normal, but is just an effect.
- Summon Creeper: Summons a Supercharged Creeper!
- Summon PigZombie: Summons a PigZombie. :D
